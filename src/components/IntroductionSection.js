        Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Saaketh Sodanapalli and I
        am currently a senior at UMass Amherst pursuing a B.S. in Computer
        Engineering and a dual B.S. in Mathematics.
      </p>
      <p className="text-content">
        I chose Computer Engineering because I wanted to understand both
        software and hardware deeply and build things from the ground up. I
        added Mathematics with a Mathematical Computing concentration because it
        aligns with my long-term interests in AI and machine learning.
      </p>
      <p className="text-content">
        Outside academics, I spend a lot of time training, including club swim
        at UMass and more running and triathlon work lately. I also enjoy
        reading, especially sci-fi, and have recently been adding more
        non-fiction as well.
      </p>
      <p className="text-content">
        Below are selected projects, followed by contact information. I am
        always open to feedback on this website and opportunities to improve it.
